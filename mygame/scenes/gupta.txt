Dear Ms Merriweather
*line_break
*line_break
Success is ours!

They took us for fools! Well more fool them.

Zhao & Jackson were too smart for their own good. They hit us with a sledgehammer when all they needed was to state their client's case with conviction.

Our case was a long shot. What jury was ever going to find a company at fault for not publicizing a top secret, technologically sensitive development such as the QA-2?

But with so much at stake, we knew Z&J wouldn't be able to resist their dirty tricks. Quantum Alchemy tarnished themselves by association, and what jury is going to side with a company who saw fit to manipulate them so?

Please find attached your spoils of this oh-so-satisfying war. You may choose to receive it in UEC, or stock options - as if you are foolhardy enough to indulge these charlatans a moment longer!

Yours sincerely
