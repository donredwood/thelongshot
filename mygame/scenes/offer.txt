Dear Ms Merriweather
*line_break
*line_break
I wanted to make sure you were aware of recent developments re: Quantum Alchemy. Their claim to have teleported an interstellar ship across the galaxy is being roundly ridiculed, and their share value is plummeting accordingly. 
*If shares > 0
	I suspect it may be time to cut your losses with this venture.

Of course, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice, but I thought it worth bringing to your attention.

*line_break
Yours sincerely
