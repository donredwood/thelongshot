Dear Ms Merriweather

I want to thank you for placing your faith in Zhao & Jackson. We are overwhelmed by the response we have received. It is only been a week, but already it seems certain that  we shall have the largest of the competing lawsuits. I would consider all investors in Quantum Alchemy indebted to you for the good choice you have made.

When suing a company, it is standard practice to sell any shares you hold in it – lest you become responsible for the debts you wish to inflict on them. If you were not lucky enough to sell off your shares before their value collapsed, please complete the attached Sell Order to free yourself of all such liabilities.

Yours sincerely
