Dear Ms Merriweather
*line_break
*line_break
I have been meaning to write to you to personally thank you for placing your trust in Quantum Alchemy. As you will be aware, mission launch was successful. We have factored into our calculations the use of a negligible number of qubits to allow Earth-side monitoring of mission progress.

So far, events are proceeding precisely as we anticipated. The closest of those rivals with whom we shared orbit will still be preparing for launch. We remain in pole position in the race towards the merged neutron star.

Our position is enviable, yet I seek to further entrench our advantage. Our technical team has been working round the clock, and have come up with a significant improvement to our strategy. This can only be enacted with the approval of 50% of our shareholders.

*line_break
It pains me not to be able to mirror the trust you have placed in Quantum Alchemy, but due to the potential value of the proposed strategy, our lawyers have insisted in formal Non-Disclosure Arrangements. If you are interested in learning more, please sign the attached contract.

*line_break
Yours forever
